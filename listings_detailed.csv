We have 2 daughters and 3 grandchildren, all of whom live in Columbus.  I've been a yoga teacher since 1988. I have taught at Yoga on High since it's inception in 2000 and earned my certification from Yoga Alliance of ERYT 500 at Yoga on High. I love sharing this ancient practice with all kinds of people. I have seen it have profound effects on people's lives. It is an honor and a responsibility for which I am very grateful. 
 Eric and I have lived in this historic home for over 35 years, in what we consider the best neighborhood in the city, Olde Towne. We love sharing our home with friends and now airbnb guests. We enjoy walking in the woods, gardening, biking, kayaking, reading and, of course, practicing yoga. 
We also love to travel. We've been told we are easy guests. We like to take care of ourselves and not add unduly to our hosts workload. Car camping is a favorite vacation of ours.
 I'd say our airbnb hosting style is also casual: I try to think of anything a guest might need and supply it, so they can have a relaxed stay with us. We have maps of the neighborhood and menus for the local cafes and the bakery in a notebook in The Loft. We try to help out with rides when we can. We have a table in The Loft that is perfect for working or dining. A guest set up her sewing machine up there.

So, while it may seem like a big city and even have all the diversity of a larger city, it is remarkably safe and quaint.  That said, our home is in what some call a ""gentrifying"" or ""revitalizing"" neighborhood.  It's not for everyone - but we love it and call it home.  Take the time to say good morning to the neighbors and kids walking down the street, and you'll quickly see what a friendly and diverse area it is.  You might meet Ms. Kay, our neighbor who was the first black family to purchase a home in this previously segregated area, or you might meet James and David, a lively couple two doors down.  Almost everyone knows us for riding bikes or hosting some of the best shin-digs around. Definitely check out the Conservatory and also the restaurants at 18th and Oak!  Also, if you make it to the Columbus Museum of Art, you might note that Emerson Burkhart's house is on our block - the corner of Woodland and Rich",,"Columbus is a car city.  Although there a buses, they aren't particularly convenient... so, consider driving.  We're pretty central to everywhere, and a few minutes from the highway, which gets you across town easily.  UBER is also great in Columbus, and fairly affordable, especially for big events where you might have to pay to park anyways.","The house is yours!  If you need anything in the kitchen, just look around.  Same for bathroom items, extra towels, etc.   Please be considerate if staying in a room that has personal items in the closets or dressers - obviously those spaces aren't intended for guests. My office is used as such, so feel free to check out the record collection or my family photos and knick-knacks, but please respect my piles.  :)","Usually one of us is around to assist.  If not, someone is always nearby.  I'm always available via email and texting!","Shoes off at the door and slippers on!  We provide down slippers for use by all of our guests, but do require that shoes are removed upon entry.  I love my hardwood floors and oriental rugs too much.   Otherwise, we're a fun, lively group.  A lengthy email with every thing you ever wanted to know about staying at Parkwood, including access information, will be sent 24 hours prior to your arrival.

The home features 4 bedrooms, and the following bed options: 1 queen size bed  1 queen size futon  3 full size beds  2 full size futons  1 couch  1 bay/reading window 2 queen size air mattresses These alone can sleep up to 20 people. If you are down with floor space, you could easily sleep more (numbers above 16 will require significant advance no",none,"Centrally located off the Livingston Corridor on the Near East Side (a few miles SE of Broad and High, the epicenter of Columbus), Old Oaks is Columbus's first and most well-preserved streetcar suburb. The neighborhood is famous not just for its architecture and history, but also for being one of the last neighborhoods in America where we know our neighbors. Each Wednesday, a different neighbor hosts a social hour on their porch and close to 30 neighbors stop by to catch up with one another. So bizarre is this in modern America that we were featured in the Washington Post for it*.  My home is central to most attractions in town, but is within walking distance to Children's Hospital. It neighbors German Village, Old Town East, Franklin Park and downtown, and is a short distance to the Short North, the OSU campus, Grandview and other central neighborhoods. Also a short bike ride from CCAD and Columbus State if you happen to be visiting either of those campuses.  For more on the Old Oaks ","If you stay throughout the week over the summer, I strongly encourage you to attend Wednesdays on the Porch, my neighborhood's weekly gathering.","Uber and Lyft are both available. It's about $8 to the short north, to give you some idea. Bus routes to downtown, where you can connect to get anywhere in the city, are a block away.  Taxis are a phone call away (It's about $8 to get downtown, $12 to the Short North, $15 to the OSU campus). Columbus's bikeshare program (CoGo Bikeshare) has a hub about a ten minute walk east by the hospital.  The recently launched carshare program, Car2Go, has cars available in the area as well. You can walk to Old Town East destinations, German Village, or Franklin Park, bike anywhere, etc.",The guest bathroom features a standing tiled shower and a jetted whirlpool tub if you need to wind down from a day on the town. The kitchen (note: not my groceries) is available for your use as well if you prefer to dine in rather than take in some local cuisine from one of our many popular restaurants. There is a large porch that overlooks the boulevard for you to enjoy.  - Short-term guests are NOT permitted to use my laundry facilities.  - Guests are not permitted to use the studio/music room unless special arrangements are made with me personally. - Smaller group reservations will not have access to the master suite.,"In addition to the lovely home, by booking with me, you also gain access to an insider's view of Columbus. I have lived here since 1999 and have friends who have lived here their whole lives who comment that I know more about the city than they ever knew possible. I am well tuned-in to events going on in the city, and can recommend restaurants or attractions to suit any taste. If you like to explore, I can show you parts of this town most don't even know exist (you'll see one such area just by staying with me).

I do both traveling and hosting on Airbnb and love both. Its just great to meet different people and visit different places. If there is anything you would like to know about Columbus when you are here don't be shy!! If I am staying with you I know I wont be shy to ask about the area.

I do have a life motto that I got from my favorite book the peaceful warrior. It is there simple words - paradox, humor, and change. If you know the book you know the meaning if you have not read the book you should.

People always ask if it’s weird to have strangers come and stay in my home with me and the answer has always been “not once!” I really love having the opportunity to share my home and city of Columbus Ohio with travelers from all over the world. The review system is a wonderful way to feel out a potential guest or host and I truly have never had a guest I didn’t enjoy.

When I bought my home in 2008 it had no plumbing, boarded up windows, and had been the ugly house on the block for a long time. I’m proud of the work I’ve done to bring a charming historic home back to life and update it in a way that kept much of the original character. Be careful asking questions about the process because I may not stop telling stories for a while.

My wife, Julie, and I are now offering part of our overgrown Victorian house to Air BnB guests.  By day I am an attorney in general practice and landlord; Julie is a psychotherapist. By free time, we are musicians (mainly a cappella vocalists though with some harmonica, clarinet, a very little tuba and hand drums thrown in.  We  enjoy jamming and improvising with others). I am a motorcyclist and lover of small affordable British roadsters, a mechanical tinkerer. We  are rehabbers/restorers of old houses with avid interests in music of all kinds, art, books, film, food (the more local and authentic the better), all manner of whiskeys and especially conversation.  I am  French by birth, and still fluent. I would say we are  Midwestern/progressive  by long residence and disposition; usually gregarious, though sometimes quieter and observant. We like to travel fairly light, although we are probably  a little ""long in the tooth"" to be truly ""spartan.""

The other bathroom has a walk-in shower. 4 - All bedrooms and full bathrooms are located on the 2nd floor.

There are buses that run throughout German Village, but we'd recommend having a car if you're looking to travel around the city, as they aren't always reliable. The one bus that we'd suggest is a free CBUS circulator bus that runs from High & Sycamore (.8 miles away - 15 min walk through the Village) up through Downtown and into the Short North. Lots of people take this bus (more than the standard bus service in Columbus), it's on time (usually!), and runs every 10-15 min 7 days a week.

Or, ask us and we'll send it to you ;) Taxi's and Ubers are also available to bring you where you need to go if you'd like to avoid having a car.","Guests have access to the whole home (except for the basement) and private backyard, as described in the listing.","We have keyless locks on our doors, so guests can check-in late as needed.

Our street, like the streets surrounding us, runs between Indianola and High Street -- the main arts, culture and food vein of Columbus. The neighborhood is a mix of classic 1920s Clintonville Bungalows and Dutch revival houses, and a pattern-blend of darling 1950s salt-box houses and cape cods -- of which our place is one! Our street is a great strolling street, with huge shade trees closer to High Street; and we're just a hop skip and a jump away from some of the city's best amenities: coffee (Global Gallery); farmers' markets (the Clintonville Farmers' Market at Dunedin and High!); co-ops (the Clintonville Community Market at Crestview and Calumet); and delicious eats (Northstar at Beechwold; Harvest and Acre by Weber). Plus, we're ridiculously close to the Park of Roses/Whetstone Rec Center/Whetstone Library; there, ","We have a lovely and very friendly pup named Isaly -- she's a border collie mix, and will probably not only request, but demand that you pet her and give her some belly rubs! We haven't heard any allergy complaints yet; but if you're seriously allergic to dogs, you may want to weigh that in your request. She'll stay in the main spaces of the house and sleep in our bedroom -- unless you let her into your room, in which case I'm sure she'd be happy to snuggle pro bono! She can be a bit shy around some folks, and has some funny fears (large flat circular shapes like manhole covers, etc.), so we'll want to introduce you all first. You'll fall in love, we swear -- we just ask, since we live not too far off the street, to ask us if you'd like to take her out to play in the backyard! We also have a very sweet matching cat, Nell, who's around some of the time; she's a pretty chill cat but might sit on your head if you want her to :) We're super-close to main bus-lines in the neighborhood; but ","We're SUPER close to the major COTA bus lines through Columbus -- the #2 and #4 buses have stops right on High Street and Indianola, on either end of our street! These will take you to campus, downtown, or anywhere you'd like. High Street is also just a short stroll or bike-ride away; and the Global Gallery Coffee shop, Boline apothecary, and Broadway block of Clintonville businesses are all within walking distance. The bike path is also just right across High Street, and, if you've got a bike or borrow ours, can get you almost anyplace you'd like to go in Columbus, with gorgeous fall colors and scenic river sounds to boot!","Your room is a cozy, all-inclusive retro den -- you'll have a swell couch, comfy bed, desk, retro sittin' chair, bedside table ... the works! We provide linens, extra blankets and a set of guest towels. You'll have full access to the bathroom (please do see House Rules for details on fragrances/chemicals), but we do not allow kitchen or living room access (only for getting water) or fridge storage, unless you specifically arrange with us in advance (and a fee will apply).

my partner jeff & i are both currently grad students -- he studies the history of industrialization and labor in the u.s. south through a history of science & technology phd. program based in philly, and i'm a folklorist and oral historian who works on the history of sustainable agriculture, food & environmental justice, & everyday perceptions of environmental toxicity. that means i get to road-trip around this fine state alot, asking people questions about how they connect food and environment health, and how they've had their lives shaped  around those questions. 

as a folklorist and oral historian, i believe in the power of everyday people's embodied and lived knowledge and experience; and my work is in documenting, interpreting and helping to present these powerful perspectives to wider audiences, to create conversations for change. i try to bring these passions to everything in my life.

i'm interested in the ways people connect food, health and environmental concern; and movement histories and futures of activism around the stuff that makes us sick, and the stuff that makes us healthy. basically, if you wanna talk farm magazines from the 1950s or the poisons & boons of various audio recorders or just like food in general, i'm yr grrl! 

because of my own history of exposure and chemical sensitivity, we try to keep (as much as possible) a non-toxic home, free of meats, chemical cleaners, and scents. and, if you come in summer or fall, you're free to help harvest goodies from our bountiful yard garden! (the ""yarden."") it can get a bit weedy this time of year; but it's all chem-free and very well loved.

columbus, ohio is my hometown (and my favorite city on earth), and we're so blessed to get to do cultural work in and around the good and environmental systems in this lovely place. we absolutely love showing people this city -- from cultural tours to the best nature spots to restaurants (even pokémon)! 

our wonderful brilliant border collie isaly will be your prime host -- she loves our guests and will happily throw you some tricks (her newest one is ""step up and kisses"") and some cuddles. we also have a lovely matching kitty named nella.

This neighborhood is part of the Short North Arts District which hosts Gallery Hop the first Saturday of every month and includes some of the best restaurants and nightlife in the city, all within a couple blocks. Goodale Park is a half a block away and includes a fountain park and 33 acres of beautiful tree-lined walkways. It was donated to the city in 1851 and is bordered by historic Victorian mansions on original brick streets. Within eyesight of the front stoop, you're close to a CVS, ATM, deli, and coffee shop on Neil Ave. You can also catch the best concerts at EXPRESS LIVE!, Columbus Clippers minor league baseball at Huntington Field, and Columbus Blue Jackets hockey in the Arena District at Nationwide Arena.","There is some minor renovation currently; the front door is being replaced soon so a couple walls are getting prepped for that and in the bedroom, the original windows are being replaced but storm windows are in place and sealed.","Most things are an easy walk! An Uber or Lyft is never more than 5 min away. The COTA Circulator bus (CBUS) is free and runs up and down High St making a loop from the Short North, Downtown, German Village and back. COTA AirConnect also runs a $2.75/trip airport shuttle bus with stops next to the convention center, right across the the park from my place. Walk Score gives my place a rating of 83 out of 100. This location is very walkable so most errands and activities can be accomplished on foot. CoGo Bike Share operates a station right across Neil Ave., just around the block. You will have one dedicated off-street parking spot next to my place. Please take note of where your spot is in your reservation details, all other off-street spots are for neighbors and my street is permit-only parking. Neil Ave. is non-permit and free to park if you need extra parking.","Listing includes guestroom, private bathroom, and one reserved off-street parking spot.

I often tell folks that if it wasn't for Columbus I wouldn't have stayed in Ohio. Columbus is truly a great city, 15th in the nation in population and a little big city that exudes charm and a vibrant, progressive culture that I'm grateful to live in. I work for a great company that I'm able to have a walking commute through historic Victorian Village and am always looking for opportunities to find undiscovered gems around town and around central Ohio. I love spending time with my chosen family of friends whether it be traveling on vacation, wine nights, movies, or happy hours. Between work and being a puppy parent to my chocolate Lab, Jonas, I'm working on finishing my degree in Public Administration with a follow-on masters degree. It's been exciting and rewarding meeting people from all over the country and beyond that I've been fortunate to host. I look forward to welcoming you for your stay in my home and in the heart of a great city like Columbus. https://www.airbnb.com/users/26073351/listings?user_id=26073351&s=50",within an hour,98%,N/A,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8db1ce33-ae08-424d-9000-ba111957ae0a.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8db1ce33-ae08-424d-9000-ba111957ae0a.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,3,3,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id', 'work_email']",t,f,"Columbus, OH, United States",,Near North/University,,Columbus,OH,43215,Columbus,"Columbus, OH",US,United States,39.97707631,-83.01129217,t,Townhouse,Private room,4,1.5,1,1,Real Bed,"{TV,Internet,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",""Free parking on premises"",""Pets live on this property"",Dog(s),Heating,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Safety card"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""Lock on bedroom door"",""24-hour check-in"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49"",""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"",""Self check-in"",Keypad,Bathtub,""Hot water"",""Bed linens"",""Extra pillows and blankets"",""Coffee maker"",Refrigerator,""Luggage dropoff allowed"",""Long term stays allowed""}",,$73.00 ,,,$0.00 ,$0.00 ,2,$20.00 ,1,1125,3 days ago,t,10,33,63,148,7/17/18,128,7/2/16,6/20/18,99,10,10,10,10,10,10,f,,,f,f,moderate,f,f,3,5.15

Columbus was developed later, across the river. Over the centuries, Franklinton flooded twice and so the neighborhood went into decline, along with other inner city neighborhoods nation wide.  Now protected by a flood wall and enjoying the renaissance of many inner city neighborhoods, it is on its way back. Very close to down town and freeway access to everywhere,  Franklinton boasts a vibrant new arts district and cute bars and breweries. It is a  mixed neighborhood in every respect. We do still have some boarded up houses next to very nice places selling for $210,000.  I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years and love it here.","Minimum stay is 4 days but if there are intervals, not booked, of less than 4 days, message me and I can approve a shorter stay.","We are surrounded by freeways so automobile travel is easy and the drive to the airport is freeway all the way. Buses crisscross the neighborhood and bicycle travel is fairly easy. A bike path runs along the north edge of Franklinton and goes for many, many miles in many directions. Down town is 1 1/2 miles east so that is even walkable or take the bus. A bus to OSU takes less than 15 minutes, drive time is 8 minutes and parking may take up longer than riding the bus! These times do get longer in peak times.","Guests have use of the whole building, The entrance is from the alley, with parking at the door, or you can come in from the front of the house and walk through the garden. Check in time can be very flexible depending only on the time needed for cleaning between guests. We are convenient to museums, libraries, art galleries, COSI and much more. The location is fabulous and Uber is wonderful to get you anywhere.","I live in the house on the same lot and work from home so I am available. Plus, I am a good cook and can help out occasionally with home cooked meals. This might be especially nice for business travelers tired of eating out.

Airbnb is now familiar and it's all good after our first year - we hope to expand to more units.  We can be about as involved as hosts as guests would like - from ""here you are, have a nice stay"" - to cooking dinner. We live on the other side of the patio which you are free to use. 

We really try to host folk who need longer stays - weeks to months, hence the 4 day minimum,  but that sometimes leaves a few days between bookings - often  on weekends. So feel free to inquire about shorter stays at short notice. 
 
We travel quite a lot and usually stay at Airbnb sites - so much nicer than fancy hotels.

Thanks for taking a moment to learn a little bit more about me. I'm a young professional who works in the Real Estate business - often times it consumes my days and nights; weekends too! However, I wouldn't have it any other way and I'm very passionate about what it do. 

Five things that I can't live without: 

1. My iphone! It's on your top 5 too! ;) 
2. My dog Tyson (Sheltie) - 5 years old & 18lbs 
3. Coffee - it's the first thing I do in the morning! 
4. Laptop - Personally/Professionally 
5. Toothbrush/Toothpaste - clean and nice teeth are a priority to me. 

I enjoy having Air BnB guest because Columbus is my roots and I get to share that with someone visiting. However, it does not stop there; it's a two-way street I get to meet people from all over the world, with stories, culture, viewpoints that I have never been exposed to in my lifetime. It's fun! I like to entertain! Of course, the few extra bucks is nice too. 

I'm Not Your Average Joe!  Look forward to meeting you in person. 

Be well & talk soon,

Thanks for taking a moment to learn a little bit more about me. I'm a young professional who works in the Real Estate business - often times it consumes my days and nights; weekends too! However, I wouldn't have it any other way and I'm very passionate about what it do. 

Five things that I can't live without: 

1. My iphone! It's on your top 5 too! ;) 
2. My dog Tyson (Sheltie) - 5 years old & 18lbs 
3. Coffee - it's the first thing I do in the morning! 
4. Laptop - Personally/Professionally 
5. Toothbrush/Toothpaste - clean and nice teeth are a priority to me. 

I enjoy having Air BnB guest because Columbus is my roots and I get to share that with someone visiting. However, it does not stop there; it's a two-way street I get to meet people from all over the world, with stories, culture, viewpoints that I have never been exposed to in my lifetime. It's fun! I like to entertain! Of course, the few extra bucks is nice too. 

I'm Not Your Average Joe!  Look forward to meeting you in person.

Archways of colored lights span High Street, the main drag through the Short North.  Originally a commercial warehouse district in the early 1900’s, the short North experienced a renaissance driven by artists and gallery owners in the 1980’s.  Now full of galleries, shops and restaurants, craft breweries and live theatre it stays pretty lively day and night. It is THE most walkable district in the city and quite safe, although it is an urban neighborhood, where it is advisable to keep your eyes open and wits about you. We have always felt quite safe here the past 25 years including raising our 2 children. And if you tire of walking you can always jump on the “C-bus” (every few minutes along High street) a free city bus dedicated exclusively to downtown, the short north and even German Village just south of downtown.

It is in keeping with the Short North's organic rebirth led by artists and gallery owners in the 1980's. And of course, there is the Ohio State University just a 5 block walk up High Street. It is perhaps the largest campus in the U.S. with 55,000+ students and home to the Buckeyes at a stadium holding nearly twice that number. The neighborhood is quite safe, although it is urban, and it is advisable to keep your eyes open and wits about you.

It is also the street which serves as the main artery through the Short North. It’s a great place to walk, look around, duck into shops, cafes, restaurants, start walking again.  There are also buses running up and down High Street which will take you anywhere in the city, but the real delight is the “C-Bus” a free city bus dedicated to serving just downtown and areas immediately adjacent including the Short North, The Arena district, the Greater Columbus Convention Center, The North Market, Downtown Columbus, and German Village immediately south of Downtown.    There are also inexpensive CoGo bicycles at several rental kiosks up and down High Street to let you explore at greater speed.","Access to Second Flight is along the walkway on the left side of the house and around back to the second flight of steps (the wooden ones) to an entrance door marked ""76 D Second Flight.""

My wife, Julie, and I are now offering part of our overgrown Victorian house to Air BnB guests.  By day I am an attorney in general practice and landlord; Julie is a psychotherapist. By free time, we are musicians (mainly a cappella vocalists though with some harmonica, clarinet, a very little tuba and hand drums thrown in.  We  enjoy jamming and improvising with others). I am a motorcyclist and lover of small affordable British roadsters, a mechanical tinkerer. We  are rehabbers/restorers of old houses with avid interests in music of all kinds, art, books, film, food (the more local and authentic the better), all manner of whiskeys and especially conversation.  I am  French by birth, and still fluent. I would say we are  Midwestern/progressive  by long residence and disposition; usually gregarious, though sometimes quieter and observant. We like to travel fairly light, although we are probably  a little ""long in the tooth"" to be truly ""spartan.""

If you have any issues during your stay, please let us know right away so we can address them! We live nearby and we want to make sure your stay is excellent.  Here are a few rules that you can follow to make us happy hosts. Rule 1: be respectful and leave the space as clean as you found it. We reserve the right to assess additional fees for cleaning or damages if these rules are not followed. Hopefully this is pretty basic stuff, but we want to be clear about how we expect our space to be used. This is not a hotel or a place to throw a party. Trash: Use the bins provided throughout the apartment. Do not leave any trash around the space. If you generate more trash than will fit in the bins, throw it away in the big green trash bins in the alley behind the house. Recycling: Use the metal bin inside the unit. As with the trash, if it fills up, take it to the alley behind the house and empty it ",,,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/fa5bb2b6-b858-4889-b620-8430ea108f9a.jpg?aki_policy=large,,52174539,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/52174539,Nat,12/24/15,"Columbus, Ohio, United States","Hi, I'm Nat!

I’m Jake. I’m originally from New York, and while I miss my friends and family back home (not to mention the beach!), I absolutely love my mid-west home here in Columbus, Ohio!
By day I’m a real estate investor and by night I’m a social butterfly with my friends. I'm also an Airbnb cohost where I mentor aspiring local hosts. I earned my Superhost status because I have high standards for value, cleanliness, and communication.
I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 12 years landlording, I’ve been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try to ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.
My life motto is, well, really my grandmother’s advice, “Jakey, live with NO REGRETS” (I can hear her thick NYer accent now). Sometimes I guess we just need a little reminder of that… And so, I invite you to travel more and see the big, beautiful world we live in.

Born in Jamaica, grew up and attended high school in South Florida. Attended and graduated college with degree in Psychology and Business. Currently working in the Information Technology Field. I am very neat, clean and organized. Don't like drama and confrontation. Like the simple life.

I was fortunate to travel to more that 25 countries and numerous international cities. My favorite countries to visit were Singapore, Hong Kong, Bermuda, Dubai and Canes. Yes, there was the most scary countries I visited were Haifa Israel, Manama Bahrain, Alexandra Egypt and Kingston Jamaica. Most memorable country I lived in was Manama Bahrain. 

There are not many things I don't like with the exception of lizards. Most noted likes are electronic gadgets, riding motor cycles, watching track and field, playing soccer and various sports, cooking authentic Caribbean cuisines and learning about other cultures.

Let me see, 5 things I can't (well choose not to) live with out... Ummmm, 1. Amazon Alexa, yes she is like my living companion. 2. Electronic gadgets - have to have the man toys. 3. The internet - would be lost without being connected to the rest of the world. 4. Music and 5. Good food.

I love the quiet times to sit back and watch a tear jerker movie and at the same time can appreciate war, drama and military movies.

I am very open minded and love to welcome guest of all diversity. But if I had to chose the ideal guest, it would be... Someone honest, neat, clean, open minded about life, food, music of other cultures. Quiet but not shy to having intellectually stimulating conversations. Someone that can appreciate quiet times, wine, jazz and movies. I don't care too much for loud and rambunctious character.

I’m Jake. I’m originally from New York, and while I miss my friends and family back home (not to mention the beach!), I absolutely love my mid-west home here in Columbus, Ohio!
By day I’m a real estate investor and by night I’m a social butterfly with my friends. I'm also an Airbnb cohost where I mentor aspiring local hosts. I earned my Superhost status because I have high standards for value, cleanliness, and communication.
I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 12 years landlording, I’ve been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try to ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.
My life motto is, well, really my grandmother’s advice, “Jakey, live with NO REGRETS” (I can hear her thick NYer accent now). Sometimes I guess we just need a little reminder of that… And so, I invite you to travel more and see the big, beautiful world we live in.

The local city and state government are spending millions gentrifying this neighborhood. It is 5 minutes from Downtown/Arena District. (Nationwide Arena, Express Live, North Market), 9 minutes from the infamous Short North. The ""art & soul"" of Columbus, the Short North is a vibrant cultural and small business community. Park your car along Goodale Park on Buttles Ave for free and gallery hop, thrift or have dinner/drinks at just about any type of bar. 8 minutes away from the Greater Convention Center. Make sure to check out my Guidebook for activities, entertainment and restaurants - it's a reference of all my favorite places in Columbus.

I use Tide detergent to wash the bed linen/body pillow. I use a regular fabric softener. If you prefer no fabric softener, please provide this information in your correspondence. I use an ink free/fragrance free toilet paper. For longer stay reservations: I offer cleaning services at an additional $40 per visit. This includes laundering bed linens/towels, vacuuming, light dusting and washing the dishes. Number of Guests: I ask that all my guests be honest and accurate in the number of guests occupying my home. Utility expenses add up for larger groups. My property is priced competitively and fairly. Utility consumption: Please be considerate of your consumption. Please turn off the T.V. and the lights when not in use. Especially the T.V. because it consumes a lot of power.",The property is ideally located on the same block to the nearest bus stop and it is also five minutes to either highways 70 & 315.,"Guests may use the middle bedroom upstairs and have full access to the first floor of the home such as the living room, dining room/bedroom, dining area, kitchen, and bathroom. The second floor is being renovated (only when the unit is vacant) and only the middle bedroom is intended for guest usage at this time. Coffee/tea/bedside chocolates are provided complimentary, however, I do ask you to reimburse me with grocery money for any wine, beer, food or snacks from the kitchen that you consume. Guests will also have access to the fenced backyard and patio. Feel free to use the gas grill - simply clean it after you are done using it. Guests can park their car in the street (no garage).","Since guests dictate how much or how little they would like to interact with me, if certain guests would like to be social and include me that is fine and for those guests who want to be independent and do their own thing that is also fine as well.","Welcome! There are some house rules: you may not smoke on the property. This is a smoke-free property. Also, please remove your shoes at the door. Feel free to help yourself to the wine, beer, snack and food items in the kitchen WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU SHALL LEAVE GROCERY MONEY ON THE COUNTER for me to replace the items that you enjoyed. Please ONLY eat in the dining and/or kitchen areas. Please DO NOT eat in the Living room - this includes the bedroom. Feel free to use the gas grill located on the back patio. Simply clean it after you are finished using it. Lastly, this is not a house to host a party. I would suggest using another venue to host your party.  -- SOME LEGAL PRINT TO READ: Smoking, house parties, and rowdy behavior are not permitted on the property.

I’m Jake. I’m originally from New York, and while I miss my friends and family back home (not to mention the beach!), I absolutely love my mid-west home here in Columbus, Ohio!
By day I’m a real estate investor and by night I’m a social butterfly with my friends. I'm also an Airbnb cohost where I mentor aspiring local hosts. I earned my Superhost status because I have high standards for value, cleanliness, and communication.
I enjoy travelling and creating new experiences. My favorite country is Guatemala. The people, the food and the historical sites are breathtaking. My favorite city is Chicago. Through these travels and coupled with my 12 years landlording, I’ve been fortunate to learn what makes a great host: a great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome neighborhood, and the ability to do the things you love! I try to ensure that each and every guest I host walks away with all of that and hopefully more.
My life motto is, well, really my grandmother’s advice, “Jakey, live with NO REGRETS” (I can hear her thick NYer accent now). Sometimes I guess we just need a little reminder of that… And so, I invite you to travel more and see the big, beautiful world we live in.

This neighborhood has experienced many phases through out it's existence, and is currently in a revitalization phase. There are lots of properties being renovated, and some that still remain boarded and empty. This area has experienced some crime in the past, but has improved in recent years.  Franklinton has experienced several great floods in the past, and has been somewhat neglected throughout the middle to late part of the 1900's. The Franklinton Floodwall, completed in 2004, is 7 miles long, cost $134 million. The wall's completion has released the area from being considered a floodplain, as well as releasing the previous building restrictions that often prevented development in the past. As a result, commercial and industrial activities are starting to grow in the Franklinton Area.  The City of Columbus is focusing on creating a new Short North style neighborhood in Franklinton",,"Uber and Lyft are great ways to get around in Columbus, and our central location allows you to get to most parts of downtown in under 10 minutes, and most other parts of Columbus in under 20 minutes.

Here are some tips to consider while in ours: *Our home is tiny, so please do not entertain guests that are not an agreed part of our visiting arrangements. ONLY PRE-APPROVED GUESTS ALLOWED. *The floor has a slight tilt to it, hardly noticeable. You may feel your body shift a millimeter to adjust to this characteristic. *If it rains, the wood on the deck can get a little slick so be careful while walking on it. *The hot water tank in our home is smaller than typical, so be creative in managing hot water use, particularly with two or more guests. *You will notice two ottomans in the living room. One contains linens and pillows for the sleeper sofa. The second one is accompanied by an eating tray with extendable legs to use as a lap table while sitting on the sofa, or just use it on the ottoman as a little table. *If it's a windy day, keep a hold of the front screen door handle as you enter and exit so it doesn't slam open. *When you leave, be sure","Parking at the house has free, first come first serve parking on the street. Please note that two of three streets around our house are free 24/7, but the third is permit only. Be sure to pay attention to the parking signs.  If you enjoy walking, many of the prime locations in close proximity are a mile or less away. The public COTA bus services the area with a bus stop on the block. UBER, Lift, and taxis are available of course. For first time UBER riders, we invite you to get your first ride free by using our invite code ""sonjad790ue"", and enjoy the excursion on us!","You will have access to the entire home, front yard, and deck.

This neighborhood has experienced many phases through out it's existence, and is currently in a revitalization phase. There are lots of properties being renovated, and some that still remain boarded and empty. This area has experienced some crime in the past, but has improved in recent years.  Franklinton has experienced several great floods in the past, and has been somewhat neglected throughout the middle to late part of the 1900's. The Franklinton Floodwall, completed in 2004, is 7 miles long, cost $134 million. The wall's completion has released the area from being considered a floodplain, as well as releasing the previous building restrictions that often prevented development in the past. As a result, commercial and industrial activities are starting to grow in the Franklinton Area.  The City of Columbus is focusing on creating a new Short North style neighborhood in Franklinton",,"Uber and Lyft are great ways to get around in Columbus, and our central location allows you to get to most parts of downtown in under 10 minutes, and most other parts of Columbus in under 20 minutes.

Our house is close to all things in Columbus through highway access. If you are looking to venture close to eat or get coffee, Bexley is a half mile away and has many great options. While there are things to do fairly close by, the neighborhood itself is not walkable and is best navigated via car.","Our family lives on the premises. During the day time you may hear us walking around the house and muffled chatting with our kids. You may hear us laughing and talking during dinner time. You may also catch us working or playing outside when it’s nice out! After 8pm you shouldn’t hear much noise beyond the occasional creaky stairs.  There is a beautiful antique claw foot tub in the bedroom, and beautifully moody private half bath. No shower however.  There is kitchenette in the living room, but there is no sink (there is a sink in the bathroom) or stove (there is a toaster oven). There is a fireplace in the living room, but it is only for use during the winter months.  There is a door in the bathroom that goes to private space and is locked.

Thanks for checking out my profile! Hopefully, I get to connect with you further through hosting you at one of my properties or staying as your guest on Airbnb. 

For me, Airbnb fulfills two of my life's biggest passions; technology and real estate. 

My first stay in an Airbnb came in 2013 while I was on a trip with my roommate to Spain.  Since then I have always been enthusiastic about experiencing unique homes in foreign places through the Airbnb platform. It wasn't until 2017, that I opened up my first Airbnb and I now wish I hadn't waited so long!! 

I’ve been investing in real estate since 2008 when I house hacked my way to my first investment property. Since that first deal, I have done dozens of real estate investments, from campus rentals to fix and flips. All along the way, I have looked at ways technology could help me invest.   As a certified millennial and real estate investor, it doesn't get much better then Airbnb.  

Here is a little more about me:

I was born and raised in Akron, Ohio, went to The Ohio State University and lived in Ohio for the first 26 years of my life. So I guess you might say I am a good 'ol midwestern boy but with one caveat, I inherited the traveling gene from my parents. It is hard keeping up with those two, they have visited all 50 states and are now retirees traveling the world. 

In 2013, on a surprisingly sunny February day in Columbus, OH, while dressed in head to toe denim for a charity bar crawl, I met my now wife, Danica (see, Ohio is for lovers ;-). Together we decided to move to California where we currently reside.  

Today, I fulfill my desire for technology as a Technical Project Manager while expanding my experience as a remote real estate investor. 

My other interests include:

- Competitive sports (mostly basketball).
- Exercise (but only so I can keep up with my wife).
- Experiencing new things, especially food (yes, I am a foodie).
- Hanging out with friends and family.

As I head into my 30's I am looking forward to growing my presence on Airbnb. I am excited for the experiences that I will have and the people I will meet as both a host and a guest.

Thanks for checking out my profile! Hopefully, I get to connect with you further through hosting you at one of my properties or staying as your guest on Airbnb. 

For me, Airbnb fulfills two of my life's biggest passions; technology and real estate. 

My first stay in an Airbnb came in 2013 while I was on a trip with my roommate to Spain.  Since then I have always been enthusiastic about experiencing unique homes in foreign places through the Airbnb platform. It wasn't until 2017, that I opened up my first Airbnb and I now wish I hadn't waited so long!! 

I’ve been investing in real estate since 2008 when I house hacked my way to my first investment property. Since that first deal, I have done dozens of real estate investments, from campus rentals to fix and flips. All along the way, I have looked at ways technology could help me invest.   As a certified millennial and real estate investor, it doesn't get much better then Airbnb.  

Here is a little more about me:

I was born and raised in Akron, Ohio, went to The Ohio State University and lived in Ohio for the first 26 years of my life. So I guess you might say I am a good 'ol midwestern boy but with one caveat, I inherited the traveling gene from my parents. It is hard keeping up with those two, they have visited all 50 states and are now retirees traveling the world. 

In 2013, on a surprisingly sunny February day in Columbus, OH, while dressed in head to toe denim for a charity bar crawl, I met my now wife, Danica (see, Ohio is for lovers ;-). Together we decided to move to California where we currently reside.  

Today, I fulfill my desire for technology as a Technical Project Manager while expanding my experience as a remote real estate investor. 

My other interests include:

- Competitive sports (mostly basketball).
- Exercise (but only so I can keep up with my wife).
- Experiencing new things, especially food (yes, I am a foodie).
- Hanging out with friends and family.

As I head into my 30's I am looking forward to growing my presence on Airbnb. I am excited for the experiences that I will have and the people I will meet as both a host and a guest.

Basically, we find a home with lots of potential, I have tons of design ideas and then he does all the hard work of bringing it to life. 

This home was supposed to be our final project, but instead we are currently looking forward to our next adventure:  building an addition to  our youngest son's house so we can enjoy his family in a small farming community outside the city. So we find ourselves in the exciting position of living in a home that we custom renovated to suit ourselves perfectly in our golden years and leaving it to spend more time with the grandkids.  It's just how things work sometimes, and we couldn't be happier with our decision!

So even with the prospect of our new house we couldn't bear the thought of selling this one that we poured so much effort into so we decided to set up an Airbnb  and allow others to enjoy it when they visit our city, and to feel the same happiness we have felt in our peaceful home. 

I have been sewing since I was a little girl, and my passion for quilting is something that has grown over the last twenty years or so.  Much of the house is decorated with quilts made by me and I hope you use them and enjoy them during your stay. 

When I travel, I like the space I stay in to feel warm, comfortable and clean, and I hope each of my guests feels the same way when they visit. We've updated our home to truly feel like an ""urban oasis"". We love that we are just a convenient 10 minutes from downtown Columbus, but that our home feels tucked quietly in the heart of a charming, small-town neighborhood.

In 2014 I had a fun year traveling- I went to Europe for 3 weeks (around 8 countries), Mexico, and California! That is the most I have traveled in a year. 

If I'm in town on the weekends I'm typically at the gym in the mornings and doing something at night. I have a small dog that I try to take everywhere (when it's not too cold out). She pretty much just lays in my bed all day. Lazy  daisy! 

I love meeting new people so If I'm not doing anything and you would like to get a glass of wine or just sit and talk on my couch I'd love your company.
